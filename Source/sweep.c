/*
* Purpose: connect a "right" vertex vEvent (one where all edges go left)
* to the unprocessed portion of the mesh.  Since there are no right-going
* edges, two regions (one above vEvent and one below) are being merged
* into one.  "regUp" is the upper of these two regions.
*
* There are two reasons for doing this (adding a right-going edge):
*  - if the two regions being merged are "inside", we must add an edge
*    to keep them separated (the combined region would not be monotone).
*  - in any case, we must leave some record of vEvent in the dictionary,
*    so that we can merge vEvent with features that we have not seen yet.
*    For example, maybe there is a vertical edge which passes just to
*    the right of vEvent; we would like to splice vEvent into this edge.
*
* However, we don't want to connect vEvent to just any vertex.  We don''t
* want the new edge to cross any other edges; otherwise we will create
* intersection vertices even when the input data had no self-intersections.
* (This is a bad thing; if the user's input data has no intersections,
* we don't want to generate any false intersections ourselves.)
*
* Our eventual goal is to connect vEvent to the leftmost unprocessed
* vertex of the combined region (the union of regUp and regLo).
* But because of unseen vertices with all right-going edges, and also
* new vertices which may be created by edge intersections, we don''t
* know where that leftmost unprocessed vertex is.  In the meantime, we
* connect vEvent to the closest vertex of either chain, and mark the region
* as "fixUpperEdge".  This flag says to delete and reconnect this edge
* to the next processed vertex on the boundary of the combined region.
* Quite possibly the vertex we connected to will turn out to be the
* closest one, in which case we won''t need to make any changes.
